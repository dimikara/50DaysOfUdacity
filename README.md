# UPDATE: #50DaysOfUdacity - The adventure continues

After the extension given for the course (30th of September, instead of the 10th), I will continue to post to in the challenge, including a new one as well: #26daysofconcepts.

Twenty-six days for the 26 letters of the English alphabet, each with important terms taken from the scholarship course or the field of Machine Learning in general.

# #50DaysOfUdacity

A simple file to keep track of my progress & posts in the `#50daysofudacity` Slack channel, after my acceptance to the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Scholarship by Microsoft.

### **What is the #50DaysOfUdacity challenge**

The premise of the challenge is to build a habit of consistent practice of new skills by making a public commitment of practicing the topics of the Foundation Course every day for 50 days!

In order to take part in this challenge, I have to:

- **[ x ] Take the public pledge** *--> Done!*

- **[ x ] Code or practice the topics of the Foundation Course for 30 minutes everyday.** *--> Done!*

- **[ x ] Post a short announcement in the  `#50daysofudacity` Slack channel, summarizing my day and note which day I am on.** *--> Done!*

- **[ x ] Encourage &  Support at least 2 peers every day.** *--> Done!*

The goal of this page is to track down the above so that I follow my progress easily and make sure not to miss a post, i.e. create my sort of **Captain's Log Book**!

I no longer remember details but during these first five days I had my first contact with the Azure environment and finished the first two lessons and the labs.
