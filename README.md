### *What is the #50DaysOfUdacity challenge*

The premise of the challenge is to build a habit of consistent practice of new skills by making a public commitment of practicing the topics of the Foundation Course every day for 50 days!

In order to take part in this challenge, I have to:

- [x] Take the public pledge *--> Done!*
- [ ] Code or practice the topics of the Foundation Course for 30 minutes everyday. *--> In progress*
- [ ] Post a short announcement in the  `#50daysofudacity` Slack channel, summarizing my day and note which day I am on. *--> In progress*
- [ ] Encourage &  Support at least 2 peers every day. *--> In progress*

The goal of this page is to track down the above so that I follow my progress easily and make sure not to miss a post, i.e. create my sort of Captain's Log Book!

## **Days 1-5:** 

*Monday, July 13rd, 2020* until *Friday, July 17th, 2020*

My posts for days 1-5 are no longer accessible in Slack, as the workspace has a limit of 10,000 messages.
I no longer remember details but during these first five days I had my first contact with the Azure environment and finished the first two lessons and the labs.
