### **What is the #50DaysOfUdacity challenge**

The premise of the challenge is to build a habit of consistent practice of new skills by making a public commitment of practicing the topics of the Foundation Course every day for 50 days!

In order to take part in this challenge, I have to:

- **[x] Take the public pledge** *--> Done*

- **[ ] Code or practice the topics of the Foundation Course for 30 minutes everyday.** *--> In progress*

- **[ ] Post a short announcement in the  `#50daysofudacity` Slack channel, summarizing my day and note which day I am on.** *--> In progress*

- **[ ] Encourage &  Support at least 2 peers every day.** *--> In progress*

The goal of this page is to track down the above so that I follow my progress easily and make sure not to miss a post, i.e. create my sort of **Captain's Log Book**!

My posts for days 1-5 are no longer accessible in Slack, as the workspace has a limit of 10,000 messages.
I no longer remember details but during these first five days I had my first contact with the Azure environment and finished the first two lessons and the labs.
